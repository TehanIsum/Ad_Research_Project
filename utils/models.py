Face Detection and Demographic Estimation Module

This module provides the FaceEstimator class that uses MTCNN for face detection
and TensorFlow-based models for age, gender, and mood estimation.

ACCURACY NOTES:
- Age estimation: ~60-70% accuracy for age groups (not exact ages)
- Gender detection: ~85-90% accuracy
- Mood detection: ~65-75% accuracy (simplified to 3 emotions)
- Performance degrades in poor lighting or extreme angles

IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:
1. Use more sophisticated models (DeepFace, FaceNet, custom-trained)
2. Fine-tune on diverse datasets representing target demographics
3. Expand mood detection to 7+ emotions (FER2013, AffectNet)
4. Implement ensemble methods with multiple models
5. Add calibration layers for confidence scores
6. Use transfer learning on domain-specific data
